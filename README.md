# Gym-Management-Website
A gym management website that uses HTML and CSS for webpages and the front-end, and utilizes Flask for the back-end. 

## **Project details**
Three HTML files comprising of a Home page, About us page and a Membership page in the 'templates' folder.
One external CSS file and images used stored in the 'static' folder.
An app.py python file that includes the python code to run the website, consisting of all the apporpriate flask syntax.

## **Purpose of this project**
This project is meant to serve as a functional website for and to promote a gym. There are three working pages that the users can interact with, all with their own respective details about the gym.

## **Instructions to run**
Make sure you are using a Python interpreter to open the app.py file. The integrity of the folder structure should not be changed. Open the terminal of your interpreter and enter the following commands:

1) python -m venv myenv (Creates a folder with a virtual environment)
2) pip install flask (To install Flask into your Python interpreter and ensure app.py runs)

After doing these, run your app.py file, and it will give you a link.
Follow the link and the website will run locally in your browser.

Note: This program needs to have a virtual environment installed and has to be run in a python interpreter that has Flask installed, the file size for the virtual environment is too big to upload.
